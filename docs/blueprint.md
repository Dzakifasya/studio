## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted blue (#73A580) to promote calm and focus. The hue is remniscent of focus/calmness/nature without resorting to the cliche of greens; also fairly desaturated, as called for.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), a very lightly desaturated near-white derived from the primary color, for a clean and modern look in a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#A080A5) to highlight important actions, which is an analogous color to the primary that offers visual interest and contrast. Much more saturated than the primary to create good contrast.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and other short pieces of text. This will lend a precise, contemporary feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer descriptions, to give a balance of modern and a little bit of personality to longform text.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent to-do categories and actions.
- Subtle animations when tasks are added or completed.
